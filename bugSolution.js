The solution to this problem usually involves carefully managing component dependencies. Ensure all dependencies are resolved before using a component.  If using dynamic imports, ensure the promise resolves before attempting to render. Here is a refactored example to show you how to fix this issue:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const ComponentB = lazy(() => import('./ComponentB'));

const ComponentA = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ComponentB />
    </Suspense>
  );
};

export default ComponentA;
```
This uses React.lazy and Suspense to handle the asynchronous loading of ComponentB. The fallback prop provides feedback to the user while the component is loaded.
